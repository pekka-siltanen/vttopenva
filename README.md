# VTT OpenVA

VTT Open VA platform consist of software components that are used as building blocks of visual analytics tools:
* Adatabase that stores the application data in a standard domain independent form
* An extendable analysis and visualization library providing a selection of analysis and visualization methods. The library is customized based on application needs
* Embedded R statistical computing environment
* A web user interface where the user can select variables for analysis and explore the data with the help of visualizations. The visualizations can be e.g. in 2D, 3D or augmented reality, and interconnected with real object visualizations. The user interface suggests the user the appropriate analysis methods letting them to concentrate on the substance instead of data analysis methods.

VTT OpenVA is independent of the underlying data collection solution.The data can come from several sources, also in realtime. The data to beanalyzed is loaded from the sources to the database through a uniform data interface.
